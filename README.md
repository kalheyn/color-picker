## Introduction
Color Picker is an engaging JavaScript mini web game created as an introduction to building user interfaces with jQuery and hosting webpages on GitHub.

A single player selects from a grid the tile with the unique color. The colors progressively become less distinguishable with every correct guess, but the player loses time with every incorrect click until it is game over.

• Built from scratch using JavaScript (jQuery), HTML, and CSS
• Internet hosting and source code management by GitHub
• Set up Google Analytics to track site usage
